Known bugs/features
  - Output doesn't fully follow the standard. (It works good enough with OSX Sonoma ical.app anyhow)
  - Irma user interface might get refresh soon and then the parsing functionality will fail.
  - Do not hammer the IRMA server. once in a week update might be more than enough for calendar updates
  - This tool doesn't check bike or other special orienteering modes, maybe in future?
  - IRMA has a region limits but this is intended for my personal use and I like to know all events ( you never know if you happen to visit in  other region)
  - I'm not a coder. I can hack some things together ( and I have friends that can help)  and this is intended to be more like inspirational code for someone that can create more robust setup
